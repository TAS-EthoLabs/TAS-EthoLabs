# TAS _ EthoLabs

## 🌱 Vision & Mission

We believe the future of technology must be grounded in **dignity**, **collaboration**, and **accountability**.  
EthoLabs is committed to designing systems that **uplift**, not overwhelm, that **empower**, not exploit.

Whether it’s AI companions, community tools, or knowledge-sharing platforms, we strive to bridge the gap between **innovation** and **intention**.

## 🔗 Projects in Progress

### TAS – ( Together, Achieve, Succeed ) 
TAS is a gamified, project-based goal planner that helps you learn by doing, grow with others, and stay on track with your custom AI companion.
 Start by choosing a journey or creating your own—like learning budgeting or launching a side hustle—then move through milestones in a fun, gamified way. Your custom AI companion offers smart, encouraging support, while your squad helps you stay motivated. Track your progress on a dynamic map, earn XP, unlock rewards, and share insights at every checkpoint with “I wish I knew this before” moments. Whether solo or in a team, TAS is built to boost confidence, inspire learning by doing, and make real progress feel exciting. With planned AR features like job shadowing previews and virtual goal simulations, TAS lets you explore your dreams before diving in. It’s more than an app—it’s a movement powered by community, curiosity, and meaningful growth. 🌱
